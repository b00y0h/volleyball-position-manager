## ðŸ“‹ Integration Demo

### Demo File

**File:** `src/volleyball-rules-engine/examples/integration-demo.ts`

Comprehensive demonstration showing:

1. **Screen to volleyball validation** - Converting existing positions for rule checking
2. **Real-time constraints** - Calculating drag boundaries during player movement
3. **Violation detection** - Identifying and reporting rule violations
4. **Coordinate migration** - Converting between coordinate systems
5. **Complete workflow** - End-to-end integration example

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirements Satisfied

### âœ… Requirement 1.6: Real-time validation

- Position snapping to valid locations when constraints are violated

### âœ… Requirement 9.1: Constraint boundaries

- Visual feedback showing allowable movement areas

### âœ… Requirement 9.2: Constraint enforcement

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

The integration maintains full backward compatibility:

- **Existing components** continue to work unchanged
- **Screen coordinates** remain the primary format for existing code
- **Position data** structure unchanged
- **API compatibility** preserved for all existing functions
- **Migration is optional** - system works with or without volleyball rules

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { useEnhancedPositionManager } from "@/hooks";
import { EnhancedDraggablePlayer } from "@/components";

// Enhanced position manager with volleyball rules
const positionManager = useEnhancedPositionManager();

// Validate current formation
const validation = positionManager.validateCurrentFormation(
  system,
  rotation,
  formation,
  rotationMap
);

// Get constraints for drag operations
const constraints = positionManager.getConstraintsForPlayer(
  system,
  rotation,
  formation,
  playerId,
  rotationMap
);
```

### Coordinate Conversion

```typescript
import { StateConverter } from "@/volleyball-rules-engine";

// Convert screen position to volleyball coordinates
const vbCoords = StateConverter.playerPositionToVolleyball(screenPosition);

// Convert formation to volleyball states for validation
const states = StateConverter.formationToVolleyballStates(
  positions,
  rotationMap,
  serverSlot
);
```

### Validation Display

```typescript
import { ValidationDisplay } from "@/components";

<ValidationDisplay
  validationResult={validationResult}
  onViolationClick={handleViolationClick}
  showDetails={true}
/>;
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

Task 9 has been **successfully completed** with comprehensive integration between the volleyball rules engine and existing coordinate system. The implementation provides:

- **Seamless coordinate conversion** between screen and volleyball coordinates
- **Real-time constraint enforcement** during drag operations
- **Visual feedback** for rule violations and valid positioning areas
- **Enhanced components** that extend existing functionality
- **Migration utilities** for legacy data support
- **Full backward compatibility** with existing codebase
