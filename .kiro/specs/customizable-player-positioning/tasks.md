  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1_

- [x] 4. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for player positioning

  - Create DragDropProvider component that wraps player dots with drag handlers
  - Implement drag start, drag move, and drag end event handlers

  - Integrate with PositionManager to update positions on successful drops
  - Add collision detection and boundary validation during drag operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Add visual indicators for customized positions

  - Modify player dot rendering to show different styles for custom vs default positions
  - Implement hover tooltips showing position customization status
  - Add visual cues in formation controls showing which rotations have custom positions
  - Create reset functionality for individual positions and entire formations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Create URL encoding and sharing system

  - Implement URLStateManager with methods to encode/decode position data
  - Add URL compression using base64 encoding for large position datasets
  - Create shareable URL generation functionality with current position state
  - Implement URL parameter parsing on application load to restore shared positions
  - Add version handling for backward compatibility with future schema changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Integrate URL state management with application lifecycle

  - Modify main component to check for URL parameters on initial load
  - Implement priority system where URL data overrides localStorage data
  - Add URL update functionality when positions change (optional for sharing)
  - Create share button/functionality to generate and display shareable URLs
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Implement read-only mode for shared configurations

  - Add read-only state management to disable drag-and-drop when viewing shared URLs
  - Create visual indicators showing when in read-only mode
  - Implement "make editable copy" functionality to create local versions of shared configs
  - Add clear messaging about shared vs local configurations
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Enhance main volleyball visualizer component with custom positioning

  - Integrate PositionManager hook into existing volleyball visualizer component
  - Replace static position calculations with dynamic custom position lookups
  - Add drag-and-drop providers around existing player dot elements
  - Implement position reset functionality in the UI
  - Maintain existing animation system while supporting custom positions
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

  - Implement error boundaries for drag-and-drop operations
  - Add user notifications for storage errors and recovery options
  - Create fallback mechanisms when localStorage is unavailable
  - Add validation error messages for invalid position attempts
  - Implement graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive test suite for all functionality

  - Write integration tests for complete drag-and-drop workflows
  - Create tests for URL sharing end-to-end functionality
  - Add tests for cross-formation position independence
  - Implement visual regression tests for custom position indicators
  - Create performance tests for large position datasets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and add final polish
  - Implement position calculation memoization for better performance
  - Add smooth animations for position resets and transitions
  - Optimize URL compression for better shareability
  - Make page.tsx not have to use 'use client'. pull interactive elements out into their own components.
  - Add keyboard accessibility for drag-and-drop operations
  - Create user documentation and help tooltips for new features
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.2, 6.2_
