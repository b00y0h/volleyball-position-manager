# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extracts the volleyball court visualization from the main page component into a standalone, reusable VolleyballCourt component that can be placed on any page and configured with custom rotations and settings. The component will fully integrate with the existing volleyball rules engine (located in src/volleyball-rules-engine/) to provide real-time validation, constraint enforcement, and educational rule feedback. This refactoring prepares the volleyball court functionality for eventual packaging as an npm module, making it easily consumable by other applications while maintaining all existing functionality including enhanced drag-and-drop positioning, formation switching, comprehensive rule validation, and violation reporting with educational context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable VolleyballCourt component that can be imported and used on any page, so that I can easily add volleyball visualization functionality to different parts of my application without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the VolleyballCourt component THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, self-contained component with minimal external dependencies
2. WHEN placing the component on a page THEN the system SHALL render a fully functional volleyball court with all existing features
3. WHEN the component is used THEN the system SHALL not require any global state or context providers from the parent application
4. WHEN multiple instances are used THEN the system SHALL maintain independent state for each component instance
5. WHEN the component is imported THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript definitions for all props and configuration options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer configuring the volleyball court, I want a comprehensive configuration object that allows me to customize rotations, formations, and behavior, so that I can adapt the component to different use cases and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing configuration THEN the system SHALL accept a config object with system type (5-1 or 6-2), initial rotation, and formation settings
2. WHEN specifying players THEN the system SHALL allow custom player definitions with names, roles, and IDs for each system type
3. WHEN configuring rotations THEN the system SHALL accept custom rotation mappings that override default positioning
4. WHEN setting initial state THEN the system SHALL allow specification of starting rotation index and formation type
5. WHEN configuring behavior THEN the system SHALL provide options for read-only mode, animation settings, and UI element visibility
6. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults that match current functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the volleyball court, I want the component to fully integrate with the volleyball rules engine, so that all positioning validation and constraint enforcement works seamlessly without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players are positioned THEN the system SHALL use the VolleyballRulesEngine for real-time validation
2. WHEN drag operations occur THEN the system SHALL enforce positioning constraints using the rules engine
3. WHEN violations are detected THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive validation feedback using the ValidationDisplay component and rules engine violation reporting
4. WHEN calculating constraints THEN the system SHALL use the ConstraintCalculator and OptimizedConstraintCalculator for real-time boundary calculation
5. WHEN snapping positions THEN the system SHALL use the rules engine's snapToValidPosition functionality
6. WHEN dragging players THEN the system SHALL use EnhancedDraggablePlayer components with visual constraint boundaries
7. WHEN the rules engine is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically benefit from improvements without component changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to handle all its own state management internally, so that I don't need to manage complex volleyball-specific state in my parent components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL initialize all necessary state internally using useEnhancedPositionManager hook
2. WHEN positions change THEN the system SHALL manage persistence automatically using LocalStorageManager and URLStateManager
3. WHEN URL sharing is used THEN the system SHALL handle URL state management internally with existing URLStateManager
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL manage error states and recovery internally using ErrorBoundary and notification system
5. WHEN notifications are needed THEN the system SHALL use the existing NotificationSystem component
6. WHEN state needs to be accessed externally THEN the system SHALL provide optional callback props for state changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for npm packaging, I want the component to be completely self-contained with minimal external dependencies, so that it can be easily distributed and consumed by other projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging the component THEN the system SHALL bundle all necessary utilities, hooks, sub-components, and the complete volleyball-rules-engine
2. WHEN importing the component THEN the system SHALL not require specific build tools or configuration beyond standard React/TypeScript setup with Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN using the component THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Tailwind CSS classes and Framer Motion animations
4. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL minimize external dependencies to React, Framer Motion, and clearly document peer dependencies
5. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL provide complete type definitions including volleyball-rules-engine types
6. WHEN the component is distributed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation, API reference, and usage examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the component, I want comprehensive customization options for appearance and behavior, so that I can adapt the volleyball court to match my application's design and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling the component THEN the system SHALL accept custom CSS classes or style props for major elements
2. WHEN configuring dimensions THEN the system SHALL allow custom court size and responsive behavior settings
3. WHEN customizing UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide options to show/hide controls, buttons, and information displays
4. WHEN theming is needed THEN the system SHALL support light/dark mode and custom color schemes
5. WHEN layout is important THEN the system SHALL provide options for different layout orientations and control positioning
6. WHEN accessibility is required THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing accessibility features and allow customization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the component, I want clear callback props for important events, so that I can respond to user interactions and state changes in my parent application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN positions change THEN the system SHALL provide onPositionChange callback with updated position data
2. WHEN rotations change THEN the system SHALL provide onRotationChange callback with new rotation index
3. WHEN formations change THEN the system SHALL provide onFormationChange callback with new formation type
4. WHEN violations occur THEN the system SHALL provide onViolation callback with violation details
5. WHEN sharing is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide onShare callback with shareable URL data
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide onError callback with error information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the refactored component to maintain all existing functionality, so that no features are lost during the extraction process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the new component THEN the system SHALL provide all drag-and-drop functionality from the original implementation
2. WHEN switching formations THEN the system SHALL maintain all animation and transition behaviors
3. WHEN using controls THEN the system SHALL provide all existing rotation controls, reset functionality, and sharing features
4. WHEN validating positions THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing validation and constraint enforcement
5. WHEN persisting state THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing localStorage and URL sharing capabilities
6. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the main page to use the new reusable component, so that there is no code duplication and the main page serves as a reference implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the main page SHALL use the new VolleyballCourt component instead of inline implementation
2. WHEN the main page renders THEN the system SHALL maintain identical appearance and functionality to the current implementation
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the main page SHALL demonstrate proper usage of the component's configuration options
4. WHEN the component is updated THEN the main page SHALL automatically benefit from improvements
5. WHEN testing the component THEN the main page SHALL serve as a comprehensive integration test
6. WHEN documenting usage THEN the main page implementation SHALL serve as a reference example for other developers
